### I'm Gary.

**Goal (really big picture)**:

Build a web interface to an automated underground greenhouse that can grow food all winter.
My main *programming* goal is to really dig in with front-end dev before moving on to the back-end stuff.  I want to be able to (quickly) convince others
that I posess this skill.  I want to reinforce my vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, and React while adding TDD and HTML Canvas to the mix.

I'd consider myself successful if I developed 15 web apps/sites this season with at least 5 via TDD.

**About Me**:

I'm always doing something.  I started a farm and it is a ton of work, but the kind that you feel good about afterwards.  

As I write this it is the beginning of October 2022.  Winter is coming which means my outdoor time is waning. I guess I should
set some goals for the down-season.  I might start taking some diesel mechanic courses which might interfere with programming, 
but I think someone who identifies as a farmer should be able to fix their own tractor!
